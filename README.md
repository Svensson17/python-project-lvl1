This is my first project on hexlet.io and in general) Here I have implemented five mini games based on mathematical questions. Examples and descriptions of it you can find below. Have a nice day)

## Start 
```console
poetry install --user
```
### Game: "Even Numbers":
```console
make brain-even
```
An user is shown a random number. The user needs to answer "yes" if the number is even or "no" if it is odd.

### Game: "Calculator":
```console
make brain-calc
```
An user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example 72 - 41, which needs to be calculated and written down the correct answer.

### Game: "Greatest common divisor":
```console
make brain-gdc
```
An user is shown two random numbers, for example, 45 and 25. The user needs calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

### Game: "Arithmetic Progression":
```console
make brain-progression
```
An user is shown a series of numbers, forming an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must determine this number.

### Game: "Is it a Prime Number?":
```console
make brain-prime
```
An user is shown a random number. The user needs to answer "yes" if the number is prime or "no" if it is not.
